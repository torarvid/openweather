## How I made the stuffs

### Beginning

* Figured Boost was the way to go
* Tried boost::program_options and failed..
* Tried *linking* with boost. That helped! ;)
* Trying to get futures/promises to work. Failing..
* #include<future> helps. I iz n00b, n0t h4x0rz

### Continuing

* Trying to think about threads+promises+futures, then discovering std::async, could that be nice?
* Yes, it seems nice so far (??) :)
* Copy/Pasted quite a bit from boost http get examples (to parse the response etc)

### TODO
* Parse JSON
* Make it look nicer
